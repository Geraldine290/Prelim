About
Bayombong, officially the Municipality of Bayombong (Gaddang: Ili na Bayombong; Ilocano: Ili ti Bayombong; Tagalog: Bayan ng Bayombong), is a 1st class municipality and capital of the province of Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 61,512 people.

Bayombong is the seat of the Provincial Capitol of Nueva Vizcaya. The name Bayombong emanated from the Gaddang word “Bayongyong” which means confluence of two or more rivers. It has been reported that a certain tribe arrived and tried to invade the place, which caused the outbreak of the first tribal war in the area. The site was renamed “Bayumbung” as a sign of the Gaddangs' first victory in fighting for their private domains.
